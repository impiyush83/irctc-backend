# IRCTC Service
A web-server (with HTTP APIs) that manages irctc travel paths.

-----
# Steps to run:
1. Install Node.js version ```8.9.1```
2. Install MongoDB Community Server edition version ```3.3.5```.
3. On command line type ```mongo``` and hit enter. (Will run Mongo on its default port ```27017```)
4. Go to root directory of *IRCTC* project.
5. On command line type ```npm install``` and hit enter.
6. On command line type ```npm start``` and hit enter.
- Yay! ðŸŽ‰ our server is up and running on default port ```3000```.
- Go through below docs, to understand the ```Entities``` and supported ```API```'s.
- Optional: You can also run test cases by ```npm test```.
-----
# Entity
- Logically there are 3 entities: `City, CityConnection & User`. If we were to design our systems in SQL DB, then there would have been 3 tables for each, having 1:n relationship between (City to CityConnections) respectively.
- But as we wanted to store data in NOSQL datastore, we have clubbed these entities into single two models as shown below. 
- Also among all the NOSQL DB's we have chosen MongoDB document data store, because it provides atomicity at the document level & is strongly consistent (providing CP of the CAP theorem).
    ```
    CitySchema - Contains city details and its neigbouring cities

    {
        "_id":  Mongo ObjectId, 
        "cityId": String,
        "cityName": String,
        "neighbours": [String]
    }
    
    
    _id        : Uniquely identifies the city. No other document can have the same value. Thus integrity is maintained across all the cities.        
    cityId     : This field is indexed and unique. Identifies cities.
    cityName   : This field is indexed and unique. Identifies cities.
    neighbours : Array of strings.
    ```
    ```
    CityConnectionSchema - Contains city connections with other cities.

    {
        "_id":  Mongo ObjectId, 
        "source": String,
        "destination": String
        "cost": Number minimum value of 1 
    }
    
    
    _id        : Uniquely identifies the city. No other document can have the same value. Thus integrity is maintained across all the cities.        
    source     : This field is indexed . Identifies cities.
    destination   : This field is indexed  Identifies cities.
    ```

- As per our use case the queries which would be much more frequent are: Get city Neighbours, get CityConnection . So as a result we are indexing **cityName**, **source**, **destination**. By default **_id** is indexed by MongoDB.
- Why **id** field is **String** data type instead of **Number** data type for **cityId**? --> Because in JS (as most of our web clients would be in JS) the Number cannot go beyond *9007199254740991*. So we don't want to limit the number of records in our table by mere **JS language's data type limitation**! That's why all id's are choosen to be of *String* data type.

# Test cases

- Run **npm test** from command line at the root directory of the project to run the test cases.
- Test cases are run on seperate **test** database. As we don't want to run test cases on our actual live DB!
